# Local Network CDN / Cache Proxy 

I created this config repo with an install script to help people in remote areas like MN, or WI with local network caching servers to improve there local network load time and "speed" while reducing conjestion and bandwidth usage
This script can be installed on any Debian based OS. I installed it on a Raspberry Pi and it worked great for local internet caching
